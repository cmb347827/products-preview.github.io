## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I relearned Sassy Css (SCSS). I have had it previously at freecodecamp.org, when I first completed their first 4 modules, but had forgotten most as it was more than a year ago.
I also learned to use media queries with SCSS instead of pure CSS, which is much more compact/cleaner code as a result.

I compiled the SCSS code as well using [Beautify Tools](https://beautifytools.com/scss-compiler.php 'SCSS compiler')


### Continued development



### Useful resources

- [Tutorialteacher](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/sass/setup-sass-development-environment) - This site was helpful in learning the basics of SCSS
- [Creative Bloq](https://www.creativebloq.com/how-to/how-to-structure-media-queries-in-sass) - This helped me understand how to implement media queries using SCSS
